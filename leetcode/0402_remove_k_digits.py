# Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

# Note:
# The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
# The given num does not contain any leading zero.
# Example 1:

# Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
# Output: "1219"
# Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

    return '0'

  # Let's try to re-form the number but 
  # anytime we find a number smaller than the number we have in the highest position so far, we throw it away
  # and make a note that we have thrown that number 
  res = [num[0]]

    while (k > 0 and len(res) > 0 and n < res[-1]):
